# Pong 1.0

I decided to create a separate repository for this game, even though it's very small. That marks the game as officially open for modification, and open-source. 

All code for this version of Pong corresponds with [FastJ release v0.3.0a.](https://github.com/lucasstarsz/FastJ-Engine/releases/tag/v0.3-alpha)
The game can be found for download here: [Pong](https://lucas-z.itch.io/pong)
